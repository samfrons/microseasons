    description: 'The first gentle winds of spring begin to melt the winter ice, marking the official start of spring in the traditional calendar.',
    longDescription: 'This microseason marks the astronomical beginning of spring, when the warm eastern winds (harukaze) arrive to thaw the frozen earth. Despite lingering cold, nature begins its subtle awakening. The east wind, considered auspicious in Japanese culture, symbolizes renewal and the promise of warmer days ahead.',

    history: {
      origin: 'Originating from ancient Chinese astronomical observations, this microseason was adopted into Japanese culture around the 7th century. The concept of the "east wind" (kochi/harukaze) appears frequently in classical Japanese literature.',
      evolution: 'Over centuries, Japanese observers refined the timing based on local climate patterns. The imagery of ice thawing became deeply symbolic in poetry and art, representing the transition from stillness to motion.',
      significance: 'Marks Risshun, one of the most important dates in the traditional calendar. Many temples hold Setsubun festivals on the eve, throwing beans to drive out demons and welcome good fortune with the new spring.',
