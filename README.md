### Digital Twin — engineering sheets
- **`/twin`**: the bioreactor calendar — a freestanding, double-sided monolith on a plinth, 36 panels per face, one per kō — as two elevations, a venue plan, ISA-5.1 P&ID sheets for the array and for every panel, and a full parameters table where every number carries its basis, all drawn from declarative specs on a blueprint plate. See [`docs/DIGITAL_TWIN.md`](docs/DIGITAL_TWIN.md).

### The 72 Microseasons
The calendar showcases all 72 traditional Japanese microseasons (kō), each lasting approximately five days and marking subtle environmental changes throughout the year. These ancient observations of nature are beautifully overlaid with the familiar Western calendar system.

## 🎨 Design Philosophy

### Visual Language
The design combines **Swiss modern precision** with **Japanese minimalist aesthetics**:

- Clean, mathematical grid system
- Generous negative space (ma - 間)
- Precise typography with careful hierarchy
- Subtle, sophisticated micro-interactions
- Premium materials and textures
- Harmonious color palettes inspired by Japanese aesthetics

### Color Palettes

**Natural**: Warm earth tones and natural materials
**Sakura**: Soft pink cherry blossom hues
**Sumi**: Traditional Japanese ink gradients
**Seasonal**: Dynamic colors that reflect each microseason

### Materials

Each material has been carefully crafted with realistic properties:
- **Wood**: Warm grain with subtle roughness
- **Washi Paper**: Soft, traditional Japanese paper texture
- **Metal**: Sleek, modern metallic finish
- **Ceramic**: Smooth, elegant glazed surface

## 🌸 The 72 Microseasons

The Japanese calendar traditionally divides the year into:
- **24 solar terms** (sekki - 節気)
- **72 microseasons** (kō - 候), each lasting ~5 days

Each microseason marks a subtle shift in nature:
- "East wind melts the ice" (February 4-8)
- "First cherry blossoms" (March 26-30)
- "Fireflies emerge" (June 11-15)
- "First frost" (October 23-27)

This calendar beautifully overlays these ancient observations with the Western calendar system, creating a unique hybrid that honors both traditions.

## 🔧 Customization

### Adding Custom Microseasons
Edit `src/data/microseasons.ts` to add location-specific microseasons:

```typescript
{
  id: 73,
  nameJa: "Your Japanese Name",
  nameEn: "Your English Translation",
  description: "Your description",
  startDate: { month: 1, day: 1 },
  endDate: { month: 1, day: 5 },
  solarTerm: "Solar Term",
  imagery: ["keyword1", "keyword2"],
  colors: ["#HEX1", "#HEX2", "#HEX3"]
}
```

### Modifying Materials
Edit `src/utils/materials.ts` to adjust material properties or add new materials.

### Customizing Colors
Update `tailwind.config.ts` to modify the color palette.
